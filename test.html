	<p>When building larger computer systems, the database soon becomes a bottleneck. Scaling out to more than one
		machine is an option, but scaling comes at a cost. And that's where the CAP theorem comes into play: it
		describes how data storage systems behave when run on multiple computers.</p>
	<p>Let's assume you have a web platform that uses some form of traditional database. This could be MySQL,
		PostgreSQL, you name it. You have your daily backups configured, everything is running smooth. However, since
		your platform is successful, your server gets more and more load. You hire a consultant to optimize it, you move
		the SQL server to a separate machine, but at some point you can't help but notice that you need to scale out
		your database to more than one server.</p>
	<p>Being the cautious person you are, you hopefully start to read up on this topic. After all, if you have two
		servers, which one is the source of truth? What if you update the same information on both servers at the same
		time? Granted, these don't seem like big issues at first, but if you don't pay attention to them, they will come
		back and haunt you.</p>
	<h2 id="the-cap-theorem">The CAP theorem</h2>
	<p>With that in mind, please let me introduce today's star of the show: the CAP theorem. As Eric Brewer states in
		his 1999 keynote, computer systems can be described with three fundamental properties: consistency, availability
		and partition tolerance. However, any one system can only satisfy two out of three of these properties.</p>
	<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>
	<p>Imagine you are writing data to a database, and you have just finished sending a larger batch of records, but are
		still waiting for the results of your insert. Suddenly the server you were writing to crashes and you are left
		wondering what happened to your data?</p>
	<p>“Classic” SQL databases running on one machine usually put great emphasis on making sure your data is either
		written fully, or is not written at all. They also ensure that whomever reads the data in the database, they
		always get the latest state, no old data is returned.</p>
	<p>However, that is not necessarily the case when talking about a distributed database setup. Data takes time to
		propagate from one server to the others, and these database engines may not have the facilities to ensure that
		your data is always written in full.</p>
	<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
	<p>This is pretty straight forward. Availability means that you can read and write data to and from any node in your
		cluster, as long as the node you are connected to isn't the one failing.</p>
	<p>However, having availability does not mean that the data you are reading is actually up to date, or if the data
		you are writing won't get lost in a subsequent crash. It just says that you can talk to a server and it will
		talk back to you.</p>
	<h2 id="partition-tolerance">Partition tolerance</h2>
	<p>Let's face it, networks aren't perfect. Partition tolerance basically means that your database won't blow up if
		the your cluster is split in two parts.</p>
	<h2 id="the-catch">The catch</h2>
	<p>Easy, right? Well, there's a catch: if you want to run your database on more than one server, <strong>partition
		tolerance is not optional</strong>. Why? Because if there is a network outage between your two (or more) nodes,
		your database blows up, and that would defeat the purpose.</p>
	<p>In other words, you're stuck with <em>having to chose</em> between consistency and availability.</p>
	<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
	<p>Let's look at a few examples.</p>
	<p><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/" title="See online https://dev.mysql.com/doc/">MySQL</a>? Well, MySQL, by
		default, isn't built for running in a cluster (except for the <a
				href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster.html"
				title="See online https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster.html">NDB</a> or Galera setup).
		Your average, run-of-the-mill MySQL server doesn't satisfy the requirements for partition tolerance, it runs on
		one server. So no partitions, no cluster.</p>
	<p>What if we run a <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-howto.html"
						   title="See online https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-howto.html">master-slave
		replication</a> MySQL setup? Well, a master-slave replication only allows writes to the master server, while
		reads can be done from slaves. Since there are multiple slaves, for <em>reads only</em> we have a setup that
		sacrifices consistency for availability. MySQL replication is asynchronous, so we are not guaranteed to have the
		latest data on our slaves, but, since we have more than one server, we can always read <em>something</em>, which
		makes the cluster available. For reads only. For writes you're fresh out of luck, if the master goes down, you
		can't write anything.</p>
	<p>What about the <a href="http://galeracluster.com/products/"
						 title="See online http://galeracluster.com/products/">Galera cluster</a>? Well, the Galera
		cluster, does <em>synchronous replication</em>. The difference is that Galera actually runs on top of InnoDB, so
		you can (mostly) use the things that you are already used to. With Galera, for every commit in your database,
		data is synchronized across the whole cluster and you only get a response once the data is successfully written
		in all nodes of the cluster. Galera also enforces quorum on cluster membership, so all the nodes must see each
		other in order to be proper members of the cluster. If a cluster is split in two, the majority of the nodes will
		form the cluster, the minority will deny any reads or writes to preserve consistency. So Galera, on a
		recommended setup, is consistent and partition tolerant, but not available.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster.html"
			  title="See online https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-cluster.html">built-in NDB cluster</a>,
		much like Galera, provides <em>synchronous replication</em> of data for a single cluster, but for multiple
		clusters the replication is asynchronous. So it gets tricky. For a single cluster NDB is consistent and
		partition tolerant, where as for multiple clusters NDB is available and partition tolerant. If you want to learn
		more, read <a href="https://messagepassing.blogspot.co.at/2012/03/cap-theorem-and-mysql-cluster.html"
					  title="See online https://messagepassing.blogspot.co.at/2012/03/cap-theorem-and-mysql-cluster.html">this
			excellent blog post</a>. One major drawback of NDB is that you have to use the special NDB table type, you
		can't use InnoDB like you normally would.</p>
	<p>Finally, let's look at <a href="https://www.elastic.co/"
								 title="See online https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a>. ElasticSearch is
		available and partition tolerant, but not consistent. If you write something and the node you have written to
		goes down, your data is gone. Also, you may end up with a situation where your node is isolated from the
		cluster. You can still read from it and write to it, but your data may never end up finding its way into the
		general cluster. Your server may crash and all your writes from that one node may be lost. I guess the caveat is
		that you should have proper monitoring when using ElasticSearch.</p>
	<p>Available and partition tolerant systems, like ElasticSearch are also described as <strong>eventually
		consistent</strong>. If you leave a cluster alone long enough, and don't write any more data, they will end up
		in the same state.</p>
	<h2 id="where-the-cap-theorem-falls-short">Where the CAP theorem falls short</h2>
	<p>The CAP theorem is a very simplistic way of describing data consistency. Lets take <a
			href="https://cassandra.apache.org/" title="See online https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> for an
		example. When writing data into Cassandra, you can decide what <a
				href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/dml/dml_config_consistency_c.html"
				title="See online https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/dml/dml_config_consistency_c.html">consistency
			level</a> you want. You can pick <code>ANY</code>, which will return after at least one node has written the
		data. You can also pick <code>QUORUM</code>, where you will wait for the majority of the nodes. Or you can pick
		<code>ALL</code>, which waits for all nodes to write the data. And there are a lot more options for all your
		refined tastes.</p>
	<p>As you can see, the CAP theorem can't really describe Cassandras behavior. Most Cassandra setups would be
		available and partition tolerant, but from a data safety standpoint Cassandra is much more reliable (on most
		settings) than ElasticSearch, for example. In other words, Cassandra is <em>consistent enough</em> for a lot of
		applications, as stupid as that sounds from a theoretical standpoint.</p>
	<p>Don't get me wrong, the CAP theorem isn't <em>wrong</em> per se, it just doesn't describe every aspect of
		consistency that you may need to know about a distributed system.</p>
	<h2 id="take-away">Take away</h2>
	<p>The take away from this is that you (probably) can't describe a database solution with one acronym. When working
		with cluster software, you need to take a long hard look at what the consistency promises are and if they match
		your business requirements.</p>
