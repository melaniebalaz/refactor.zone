You might have heard the term “clean code”. Most probably in the context of writing better, more reusable pieces of software. But what is it and how do you do it? Let's take a look.

The term “clean code” was most probably coined by Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin, who write a book with the same title. You might want to give it a read, although, I find it to be very wordy. The book covers a few underlying principles that should help you write modular code in such a way that those modules can be reused.
