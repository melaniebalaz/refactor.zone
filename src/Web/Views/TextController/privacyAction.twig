						</h2>

						<p>
							The Refactor Zone respects your privacy. We aim to keep your information as private as
							possible, so we do not use any third party tracking tools of any sort and only basic
							server logs for maintenance purposes and anonymized usage data to better understand our
							visitors needs.
						</p>

						<p>
							You can disable usage tracking by blocking the domain <code>track.opsbears.com</code>,
							disabling JavaScript or setting the Do-Not-Track functionality in your browser. Server
							logs, however, cannot be disabled as they are required by server maintenance.
						</p>

						<h2>Use of cookies</h2>

						<p>
							Our usage tracking software uses cookies to identify users. These cookies can be blocked
							by using a privacy addon, such as Ghostery, setting the Do-Not-Track functionality in
							your browser, disabling JavaScript or by blocking the <code>track.opsbears.com</code>
							domain in your browser.
						</p>

						<h2>Custodian of Data</h2>
